					<h2>fearnlj01</h2>
					<p>Fearn was one of the first Super Admins. He knows how to enforce rules while not ruining the fun. He has helped with making the website, configuring and maintaining ALL of our hosted services (game/mail/bot servers,) moderating and maintaining the discord server, advanced NadekoBot support, and to be honest, much more that I can't remember.</p>

						<h2>Poncethecat</h2>
						<p>Ponce joined from Reddit when he heard I was looking for a bot that could schedule repeated commands. In less than a day, he created most of iAdmin's current functionality. He became the quickest member promoted to Super Admin for the hard work he has put into both making the bot, and helping in the discord server. On top of that, he helps configure/maintain our hosted services (mainly responsible for the minecraft server, screenshot server, and status site) moderating and maintaining the discord server, and other behind-the-scenes stuff we have planned for the future.</p>

						<h2>Worluvus, Ventus, D Money, and Miku</h2>
						<p>These guys provide a fun and welcoming community for everyone. They are always participating and helping new members get into the feel of how we party here. Without, the server would be much less active. They also moderate and maintain the discord server.</p>

							<h2>Mishiki</h2>
							<p>Mishiki helps test the hosted servers before changes are made public. He also maintains the Team Fortress 2 server, and moderates the discord server, as well as getting people to join the Minecraft and Garry's Mod servers.</p>

					<h2>Miako</h2>
					<p>Miako helped setting up the mail server, as well as troubleshoot the advanced issues we had during the setup. His experience with Linux has provided solid improvements to our servers. He is now involved in our backend maintenance.</p>

					<h2>EVeryone Else</h2>
					<p>I really want to make a personal thank you to everyone, there's just too many of you. Between making the community so fun to be in, helping moderate the discord, joining in on game servers, using the bots, or even providing your input on issues that arise, you guys got my back. The amount of support is amazing. Every single Super Admin, Admin's Admin, Yung Admin, Janitor, Contributor, thank you so much. I've gotten to know almost all of you personally and you guys are fire.</p>
