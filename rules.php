					<p>-Keep drama and harassment out, there is no place for it here. If someone says stop, please stop. This includes racism/derogatory comments. Take personal beef into the DMs.</p>
					<p>-Explicit channels (marked as not safe for work) contain explicit content. Only go in if you are legal. You are agreeing to this by saying >accept when you join.</p>
					<p>-Try to stick to the channel topics. The general chats are #shitpost (not safe for work) and #greentext (safe for work.)</p>
					<p>-Reasonable advertising or self-promotion is allowed once a day (lenient) and ONLY in the #advertising_and_promotion, but if you're only here to advertise you may be kicked/banned. More notes about advertising further down.</p>
					<p>-The Chill Zone voice chat is for calm and chill voice chats.  The Loud Zone voice chat is for loud people. Don't mic spam in chill zone, and be somewhat reasonable in the Loud Zone.</p>
					<p>-Not safe for life content is forbidden, along with illegal content like child pornography.</p>
					<p>-Treat the admins well and they will treat you well. They are allowed to operate to the full extent of their perms. Don't ask for perms either.</p>
					<p>-If you need to appeal any actions, we have an "Open Door" policy, feel free to reach out to a higher up, or me.</p>
					<p>-In general, just use common sense and you'll be fine.</p>
					<p>-Hang out, invite your friends, and have fun!</p>
					<p>-I am trying to create a fun and open community for everyone. If your actions impede this goal, the admins will remove you.</p>

					<h2>Advertising and Promotion</h2>
					<p>You are more than welcome to advertise, but ONLY in the #advertising_and_promotion channel, unless it's within context otherwise.</p>
					<h2>In this channel:</h2>
					<p>-You are not allowed to mention anyone unless it is an individual who has given consent.</p>
					<p>-You are not allowed to post the same thing more than once a day, be it a video, or stream, or server link. Multiple posts are allowed for *different* videos.</p>
					<p>-Do not spam! Spamming is up to the admins to define in terms of frequency.</p>
					<p>-Everything posted must follow server-wide rules found at the top of this page, or in #faq</p>

						<h2>Who enforces the rules?</h2>
						<p>-Anyone with the Super Admin, Admin's Admin, or Young admin "perm" role assigned.</p>
						<p>-You may occasionally find someone with an admin role without "perm", that is just the displayed role and if they don't have that "perm" then they are just meme-ing.</p>
